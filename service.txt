Hello there! This is a sample file to demonstrate Bash scripting. 
hello world! Let's see how this text is modified.
Another hello here just to test multiple replacements.

Bash scripting is an essential skill for Linux administrators.
It allows automating tasks like this one. The word hello appears a few times in this text.
Do you think the word hello should also appear in uppercase? HELLO, there it is!

Moreover, scripting becomes fun when you see instant results. hello, hello, and hello again.
Scripts save time by automating repetitive tasks like replacing hello with hi.
Have you ever used the sed command before? It's fantastic for replacements like these.

HELLO! This paragraph was created just to ensure case-insensitivity is respected.
Let’s ensure that all instances of hello, HELLO, or Hello are replaced with hi.
If not, you’ll have to debug the script!
