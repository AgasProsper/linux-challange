This file contains no occurrences of the word "hello" or any of its variations. 
Itâ€™s here to test that the script correctly skips files without the target word.

Bash scripting is not only about automation but also about ensuring scripts are efficient.
Efficiency means skipping unnecessary work, like editing this file.

By keeping this file intact, the script demonstrates it doesn't modify files unnecessarily.
This is a useful feature, especially for large directories with mixed content.
